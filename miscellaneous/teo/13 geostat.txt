#### Geostat Notes
-> foto binned variogram: it stabilizes
-> model y(si) = a0 + delta(si)
-> model assumptions: E[delta(si)] = 0, and II order stationarity:
		E[z(si)] = m independent from si
		Cov(z(s1),z(s2))=Cov(delts(s1),delta(s2))
-> foto fitted model with gls

-> universal kriging -> we relax secodn order stationarity, say E[z(si)]=msi

BLUE = TRUE -> MEAN
BLUE = FALSE -> PREDICTION





Model assumptions

- The ordinary Kriging model assumes II order stationariety ( E[z_s] = m for any s and Cov(z_s1,z_s2) = C(h) where h = norm(s_1 - s_2) ), and isotropy. We also assume that C(•) is known.

- The universal Kriging model assumes z_s = m_s + delta_s for any s in D (domain) where m_s is called drift and describes the non constant spacial mean variation. Moreover we assume E[delta_s] = 0 for any s in D (so that E[z_s] = m_s) and that Cov(z_s1,z_s2) = Cov(delta_s1,delta_s2) for any pair. We also assume that C(•) is known and that m_s follows a linear model m_s(t) = sum_l=0^L a_l(t) f_l(s) for s in D and t in T, where f are known functions of s and a_l are coefficients independent from the spacial location.
